# Tetris Remake
## Introduction
Tetris has been a game that I have loved since childhood. From first discovering Tetris Blitz on my iPad to competing on Jstris with friends during study breaks, it has always been a staple in my game library. Hence, I created this project out of personal interest to reflect my hobbies and apply my knowledge of Object Oriented Progaming in C++. Many features of this project were adapted from this [tutorial](https://m.youtube.com/watch?si=uf-8EqsuYmcLMLbP&v=wVYKG_ch4yM&feature=youtu.be), but I typed every line of code and implemented many additional funtionalities as well. Most notably, the drop block and save block features which are crucial are game mechanics in the aspect of user experience.

In this project I:
- Demonstrated my understading of encapsulation through deciding the scope of fields and methods
- Leveraged stack and heap memory to reduce runtime
- Managed real-time user inout by translating keypresses to block movements
- Integrated multiple algorithms such as board generation, collision detection, and future path generation

## Controls
